This directory contains the EDA files for schematic and PCB layout, component bill of materials, as well as Gerber and NC Drill manufacturing output files. Note that there are two drill files: one for plated through-holes (PTH), and one for non-plated through-holes (NPTH). Both should be supplied to the PCB manufacturer.

PCB specifications:

- 1.6 mm
- Two layer
- 2 oz / 70 um copper

Schematic and PCB layout were produced with DipTrace version 3.3.1.
